        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Akshat Srivastava, a passionate and curious Bachelor of Computer Applications
            (BCA) student with a strong interest in web development, software engineering, and
            emerging technologies. I enjoy solving problems through code and constantly seek
            opportunities to grow both technically and personally.
            Currently pursuing my graduation, I have built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and I'm actively working on real-world projects to enhance my skills. I
            also enjoy learning about new tools and frameworks and am always eager to take on
            new challenges.
        </p>
